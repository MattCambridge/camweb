4.the img folder is where all the images go for your website. to use any images in the image folder in your html just pre-fix img/ to the files name. for exsample if you had a image called logo.jpg your html img tag would look like this <img src="img/logo.jpg" alt="my amazing logo"/> 

to use images in your css (main.css) just prefix your file with ../img for exsample if your file was called background.jpg your css would look like this 

div{
background-image:url(../img/background.jpg yqaa5r);
}
